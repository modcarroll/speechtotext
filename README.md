This is intended for use with IBM's Watson Speech to Text service. Use the results of that service here.

## Instructions:

1. Save the output from your curl command to your desktop as a .txt file named "input-text.txt"
2. If you haven't downloaded and installed Python, you can do that here: https://www.python.org/downloads/ Either version will work for this
3. After you have installed Python, open your Terminal and 'cd' to your Desktop
4. Type 'python speechtotext.py' and click Enter
5. This will save a file on your desktop called 'Text-to-Speech-Output.txt' which will contain the transcribed text


## A couple of things to keep in mind:
- The .py file and input-text.txt must be located in the same directory.
- This is case-sensitive, so make sure to type everything exactly as shown in the directions.
